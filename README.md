* When working on your ticket, **make sure to run `git pull && git checkout -b feature/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-feature-I-will-be-working-on`_first_** to avoid this critical mistake.
* Branch names should have one of these prefixes: `feature/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-`, `bugfix/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-`
    - For example, `feature/14-backend-skeleton` or `bugfix/102-ios-data-loading`
* For PR, share a link in the Discord osucoding chat to request code review.
